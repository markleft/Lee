# Installation
Installation is fairly simple. This bot will work only on Linux.

Newest [**toxcore**](https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore) is required. For instructions on how to get it, please refer to its [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/irungentoo/toxcore/blob/master/INSTALL.md).

1. Install [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org/)
2. Make with `cargo build`
3. Run with `./target/debug/./lee`

# Usage

There should be a file named `markov.txt` available in working directory, containing sentences that could be used to initially feed bot, or `markov.json`, which will be generated by bot, so that there would be some initial strings to work with.

`markov.txt` will be used only when `markov.json` is not available.


## Formatting of markov.txt

Custom formatting of file is used.<br/>
Lines starting with ``//`` or ``/*`` are ignored.<br/>
Lines ending with ``\\`` are joined with next line.<br/>
Last line in a file should not be empty.<br/>


Currently supported by Lee commands are:

## Groupchat commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| .about  | Send "About" message         |
| .id     | Lee will say its ID          |
| .talk   | Turns on talking on its own  |
| .stahp  | Turns off talking on its own |

By default Lee talks on its own at random times, few times per hour.

Even after turning off random talk on its own, Lee will respond to `highlighting`, i.e. to someone mentioning its name.


## Friend commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| invite  | Invites to last groupchat in which someone spoke |
